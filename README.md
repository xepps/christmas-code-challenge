# Christmas Tech Discussion Code Challenges
## Ho Ho Ho! - Letâ€™s get merry and solve problems!

In the given time, your challenge is to solve the following problems. Points will be awarded for solving each puzzle, with each puzzle worth a set number of points. 

Also, bonus points will be awarded for each of the following (at my discretion):
* one bonus point for adding ascii decorations to your code; 
* one bonus point (per completed challenge) for jazzing up your computer with a christmas theme (backgrounds, fancy cursor icons etc);
* two bonus points for formatting your code in Christmas shapes; 
* five bonus points for the best team name;
* five bonus points if you finish all the code challenges, but were not first;
* eight bonus points if you finish all the code challenges first.

The challenges can be completed either on your own or in teams of up to 3. Challenges can be completed in any language, but I have provided some boilerplate javascript if you want a quick start. They can also be completed in any order so you can try and maximise your points!

After completing a challenge, come and see me to validate your code and award your points.

The person or team who has the most points at the end of the session wins a mystery prize!
