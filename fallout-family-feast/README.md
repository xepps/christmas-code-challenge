# Challenge 1 - Fallout Family Feast

## Description
Just in time for Christmas in the Fallout universe, scientists have finally completed mixing the genes of partridges and pear trees. The fruit of this new plant has been discovered to have wondrous properties: it can feed one person for a whole week and the plant never dies!

Fruits need one week to grow, so each week you can harvest its fruits. Also, the plant gives one fruit more than the week before. To grow more plants, you only need to plant a fruit.

As a member of the biochemistry division of the institute, your job is to calculate how many weeks it would take for you to cultivate enough fruit to sustain a vault of x people, given y fruits to start with.

## Input Description
Your program should accept two positive integers, x and y, where x is the number of people in a vault and y is the number of fruits to start with.

## Output Description
An integer value representing the number of weeks it would take to cultivate enough fruit to sustain the vault.

## Points
This challenge is worth 10 points.
